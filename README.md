# What is DaoFlow?

DaoFlow is an open-source platform-as-a-service solution for you and your companies to grow your business with minimal setup on bare metal VMs like Hetzner/OVH/DigitalOcean, or even AWS/Azure/Google Cloud/etc.


## What problem does it solve?

- For startups/indie developers: Saving time / cost / money on infrastructure and cloud computing services (see appendix 1).
- For enterprises: Scaling up your business with minimal setup on bare metal VMs with much lower cost than cloud computing (see appendix 2).

## Goals / Roadmap

- Vercel-like deployment experience with nearly zero configuration with CLI tools for common stacks including Next.js and Hono.
- Docker/Container first approach to deployment with Docker Compose and optionally Docker Swarm.
- Support for multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, Hetzner, etc.).
- Suepr quick setup and deployment, targeting less than 5 minutes.
- Markplace for mature stacks like Sentry, Langfuse, .etc.

## Status

Currently, DaoFlow is in closed alpha stage. Please subscribe to the release notifications of this GitHub repository to be notified when the project is ready for beta testing.

## Draft: Architecture
